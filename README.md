# Overview
For this project I wanted to learn the basics of Dart before moving on to mobile app development with Flutter. To do this I created a simple game loosely based 
off of Dungeons and Dragons, which uses all the basic programming constructs, data structures, object classes, and class inheritance. The game itself is not yet 
finished, but at this point the user can create a character, and view the character's stats and items. These classes I created will eventually be implemented in
an adventure where the player can buy and sell items at a merchant shop, and take on contracts to combat monsters.
